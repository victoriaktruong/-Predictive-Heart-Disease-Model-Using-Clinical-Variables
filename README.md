# Predictive Heart Disease Model

## Background

Heart disease stands as a significant public health concern, ranking as the second leading cause of death in Canada. Statistics reveal hat approximately one in twelve Canadians aged twenty and above sufer from heart disease, underling the pervasive nature of this health issue. Predictive modeling for heart disease vital for preventative care; the ability to anticipate an individual's risk of heart disease holds the potential to revolutionize preventative care strategies. Timely identification and intervention can substantially reduce the likelihood of fatal outcomes, contributing to improved patient outcomes and overall well-being. 

## Dataset 

The dataset used for this project consists of clinical data collected from 1018 high-risk patients, encompassing 13 variables, each holding valuable insights into potential risk factors and clinical indicators. Originally sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository[^1], the dataset was made available on Kaggle[^2]. The roots of this dataset can be traced back to a research paper publoshed in 1989 by Detrano et al[^3]. The dataset's incorporation of diverse clinical variables from this study not only enriches our analysis but also aligns with the continuous efforts to advance predictive healthcare models and enhance preventive care strategies.

The table below shows the variables used for analysis:

| Continuous          | Categorical                   |          | 
|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------| 
| Age (mean = 54.4) | Sex (M/F)                      | Resting ECG (normal or abnormal) | 
| Resting blood pressure | Fasting blood sugar (<120 or >120) | Exercise induced angina (presence or absence) |
| Cholesterol        | Heart disease (presence or absence)  | ST slope (upsloping, downsloping, or flat) |
| Maximum heart rate | Major vessels count (0-4)     | Chest pain type (typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, asymptomatic) |
| Old peak           |  | |
                                |
